# Terms of Service for Chroma Color

Last Updated: February 13, 2025

## What is Chroma Color?

Chroma Color is a simple Chrome extension that helps you grab color schemes and font information from websites you visit. Think of it as your personal design assistant that can tell you exactly what colors and fonts a website is using.

## Your Privacy is Our Priority

We believe in complete transparency, so here's the most important thing you should know: **Your data stays on your device. Period.**

- The extension NEVER sends any data to our servers or anyone else
- We NEVER track your browsing
- We NEVER collect personal information
- We NEVER store any information about the websites you analyze

## How Does It Work?

1. You visit a website you like
2. You click the Chroma Color icon
3. The extension looks at the current page's colors and fonts
4. You get an instant style guide

That's it! Everything happens right in your browser.

## What Permissions Does It Need?

The extension needs two permissions to work:
- **Active Tab**: This lets us look at the current webpage's design when you click our icon
- **Scripting**: This helps us find colors and fonts that might be hidden in the webpage's code

We only use these permissions when you click the extension icon - never in the background.

## Using Chroma Color

You agree to:
- Use the extension legally and responsibly
- Not modify or hack the extension
- Not use it to harm others

## What You Should Know

- The extension works as-is, and we can't guarantee it will catch every single color or font on a website
- Sometimes websites load content in special ways that might make some colors or fonts harder to detect
- User privacy is our top priority, we will never change the terms in order to harm our users in any way
